# better-weather-app

## Uses?

##### A basic weather app to know how hot/humid it is and laugh at the ridiculous amount of unneeded attention I have given to this.

## How to use

Clone or whatever, npm-install or whatever, node src/app.js or whatever, go to your browser and search http://localhost:3000/ or whatever, and now just search.
